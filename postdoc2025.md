# Postdoctoral Position - McGill University, Canada 
  
We invite applications for a postdoctoral research position, for **one year** (**renewable for a second year**) in the topic of low-code development guided by intentions. This position offers the opportunity to work at the intersection of **Software Engineering** and **Artificial Intelligence** (AI), focusing on the formal modelling and generation of **AI pipelines**. 
  
### Research Focus 
Researchers across numerous scientific domains are exploiting AI and Machine Learning (ML) in their research. Unfortunately, building efficient AI/ML pipelines to analyze domain specific data remains challenging, notably because it requires researchers to develop a strong expertise both in programming and AI concepts. 
The goal of this postdoctoral research is to improve the efficiency and accessibility of AI pipeline development, by developing a low-code approach to describe and generate AI pipelines which can be tailored to specific domains. 
 
### Responsibilities 
- Analyze and model AI pipelines from different research domains. 
- Identify and formalize common and variant features of these pipelines. 
- Develop a low-code solution that allows for the automated generation of AI pipelines. 
- Collaborate with researchers from various fields to validate the solution. 
  
### Qualifications 
- Ph.D. in a related field (e.g., computer science, AI). 
- Experience in modelling, AI pipeline development, and/or low-code development. 
- Strong analytical and problem-solving skills. 
 
### Practical information 
- The selected candidate will work under the supervision of Jessie Galasso (McGill University), Houari Sahraoui (Université de Montréal) and Ulrich Aïvodji (ÉTS), in Montréal, Canada. 
- The position is available immediately, with an **ideal start in January 2025**. 
- Candidates should submit a cover letter and a research CV to jessie.galasso-carbonnel@mcgill.ca
