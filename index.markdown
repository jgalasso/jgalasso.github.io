Since August 2023, I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.mcgill.ca/ece/) of the [Faculty of Engineering](https://www.mcgill.ca/engineering/) at McGill University. My research interests include software reverse engineering, knowledge extraction and representation, variability management and modeling, and software repository mining.

I received a Ph.D in Computer Science in 2018 from the University of Montpellier (France), during which I worked with symbolic AI for model extraction and software product line reverse engineering. I continued this work with complex software product lines as a teaching and research assistant between 2018 and 2019. From 2019 to 2020, I worked on problematics related to knowledge representation, interoperability and ontology matching at the [French National Institute for Sustainable Development](https://www.ird.fr/) (IRD). 
Between 2020 and 2023, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the [Geodes](http://geodes.iro.umontreal.ca/fr/) group at the University of Montréal.  I obtained an [IVADO](https://ivado.ca/en/) [postdoctoral research funding](https://ivado.ca/en/scholarships-and-grants/postdoctoral-research-funding/) in October 2020 to work on machine learning and optimisation approaches for source code recommendation.
